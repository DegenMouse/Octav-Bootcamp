A robust file backup solution that demonstrates Rust's capabilities in system programming and file handling. Features include:
- Automated file synchronization
- Configurable backup schedules
- Progress tracking and logging
- Error handling and recovery
- File encryption

### üå§Ô∏è Weather Application
A modern weather application that showcases Rust's ability to work with external APIs and handle asynchronous operations. Features include:
- Real-time weather data fetching
- Location-based weather information
- Live weather comparison between different locations
- Temperature and forecast display

### üîê Hash Cracker
A powerful tool demonstrating Rust's performance capabilities in cryptographic operations. Features include:
- Multiple hashing algorithm support
- Dictionary-based password cracking
- Performance optimization

## Other Projects

- **CLI Calculator**: A command-line calculator demonstrating basic arithmetic operations
- **CLI Wallet**: A secure command-line wallet implementation
- **P2P Handshake**: Implementation of peer-to-peer communication protocols
- **CSV Serde**: CSV file handling with serialization/deserialization
- **Stacks Wallet Library**: Blockchain wallet implementation

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

3. Navigate to the specific project directory:
```bash
cd [project-name]
```

4. Build and run:
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Learning Journey

My journey with Rust began with simple command-line applications and gradually progressed to more complex projects. Each project was chosen to explore different aspects of Rust:

- Memory safety and ownership model
- Concurrency and async programming
- Error handling and Result types
- System programming capabilities
- Performance optimization
- External crate integration
- Testing and documentation
